# validator

Before we evaluate the dataset we generated by running both EPF and AFLNet, we have to validate the fuzzer's reported crashes for their validity and reproducibilty.

This small go-project spawns hundreds of worker threads that execute their isolated process instance of the target application with enabled ASAN. It then consumes a newline-separated list
of file paths to the bug reports, distributes it across the worker threads, and lets them replay the payload against the target. We give a gracious timeout, collect exit codes, and
aggregate the ASAN stack traces on crash into a single csv file that will be used for further crash analysis.
